// Many-Item Pointers
// ------------------
// Sometimes you may have a pointer to an unknown amount of elements.
// [*]T is the solution for this, which works like *T but also supports
// indexing syntax, pointer arithmetic, and slicing. Unlike *T, it
// cannot point to a type which does not have a known size. *T
// coerces to [*]T.

// These many pointers may point to any amount of elements, including
// 0 and 1.
