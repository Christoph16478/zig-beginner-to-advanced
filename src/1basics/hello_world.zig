const std = @import("std");
// Imports
// -------
// The built-in function @import takes in a file, and gives you a
// struct type based on that file. All declarations labelled as pub
// (for public) will end up in this struct type, ready for use.

// @import("std") //  is a special case in the compiler, and gives you access to the standard library. Other @imports will take in a file path, or a package name (more on packages in a later chapter).

// We will explore more of the standard library in later chapters.

pub fn main() void {
    std.debug.print("Hello, {s}!\n", .{"World"});
